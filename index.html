                    Sometimes movies are more complicated than four-volume novels. 
                    But you learn to read books in school, but you don't learn to watch movies. 
                    And without preparation, it can be difficult to enjoy watching a movie.

                    In this 8-session course we will learn how to be conscious viewers. 
                    We will get acquainted with the stages of film production and learn 
                    how to watch a movie through the eyes of a screenwriter, director and 
                    editor. We will understand genres and look at the most important films, from 
                    Citizen Kane to The Matrix.
